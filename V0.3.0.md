# Atom-iQ v0.3.0 Roadmap
1. Simplify Event Delegation (done)
    - Remove "reactive (operator) event handlers", like `onClick$` (with `$` suffix) - they were
      accepting **RxJS** operator functions (or many of them, with `pipe` utility function). They seemed
      to be not very useful feature and had negative impact on performance. Everything they provided,
      should be achievable in similar way, with just classic (function) handlers. Furthermore, it should
      be  even simpler and a faster.
    - Change (simplify) `eventState` function
      - use `BehaviorSubject` instead of `ReplaySubject`
      - `connectEvent` function now returns a classic handler, that's just "nexting"
        each event with Subject
      - it should be a big advantage for `eventState` performance
2. Fork and adapt (performance improvement) **RxJS**
    - Work in progress, currently still in **RxJS** forked repo, to get the latest updates from **RxJS**
        - should be moved to this monorepo with new names, in example `@atom-iq/observable` and `@atom-iq/operators`
        - before, creating 1000 DOM Elements (on my laptop) took ~170ms (very bad result,
          Atom-iQ is the fastest in the world in DOM updates, but creating new elements is bad
          and main target for v0.3.0 changes) - clean, fastest VanillaJS implementation is about 100ms.
          So we are 70ms behind and 40ms from it is caused by creating and subscribing to Observables. Currently,
          implemented changes reduces it to 20ms and overall score to 150ms, so it's a lot better,
          but I think we could achieve 10-15ms with next changes. Rest 30ms is caused by Reactive Virtual DOM
          children managers and will be described in point 3
    - Remove deprecated features and changes planned for **RxJS** v8 - as our
      version of **RxJS** doesn't need backward compatibility
      - deprecated sync error handling and this context in subscribe
      - deprecated static method `Observable.create`
      - lot of other small changes marked as deprecated and to remove in v8
    - Probably most important change - remove `lift` and change the operator creation
      logic - **RxJS** team is also thinking about it for v8
      - `operate` function, now simply creates new Observable and passes source
      and subscribe to provided callback
      - however, I'm planning to check the solution similar to that used
        by `@most/core` - subclass `Observable` for every operator (`most` has
        just classes that implements `Stream` interface), implement `_subscribe`
        method and pass operator data (callback function etc.) to constructor.
        In current solution, we're creating closures and keeping operator data
        into it's scope - it should be faster if it will be in object fields
    - Simplify `Observable` class
      - Remove `lift` method as stated above and connected fields: `source` and `operator`
      - Remove methods that are useless for the Atom-iQ apps:
        - `forEach`
        - `toPromise` (also deprecated)
        - that methods are for easier integration with APIs, that need *Promises* - that's
          not **Atom-iQ**, where all asynchronous logic is handled by Observable streams
      - Remove `pipe` util method - it's a standard in **RxJS** and its community, but in my
        opinion it's just polluting `Observable` interface and objects - `pipe` utility
        function could be used instead and new similar utility function should
        be introduced, that's accepting stream as first (or first function) argument and operators
        as the rest arguments (or second function arguments) - example:
        ```
          const oneSecond$ = interval(1000)
          const evenCounter$ = compose(
             oneSecond$,
             filter(count => count % 2 === 0),
             map(count => `${count}s`)
          )
          // OR
          const composable = compose(oneSecond$)
          const oddCounter$ = composable(
             filter(count => count % 2 !== 0),
             map(count => `${count}s`)
          )
        ```
3. Children manager(s) changes
  - Children manager in Atom-iQ, is internal representation of currently rendered elements. Thanks to it,
    Atom-iQ knows on which position it should render every element, in different points in time. It also enables
    unique, true scheduled, asynchronous rendering - that's not possible in classic Virtual DOM. Let's take simple
    component as example, which has 5 elements - second one is rendered after 1000ms delay, the others immediately.
    In Virtual Dom, in example React, it's always 2 operations - first is to render all elements, with null for delayed
    one, second is to render elements with delayed one (so, it's second vdom diffing). In Atom-iQ it's **always** just
    one operation (with operation, I mean rendering cycle) - render immediate elements, subscribe to delayed element
    and render it after 1s and without touching other rendered elements or any other RvDOM logic
  - However, I made a series of big mistakes - in the first version, when new element was added, the array of indexes with
    index of new element was sorted and position was known. But with a lot of elements, sorting array every time, was a total
    overkill. After changes, it was instead looking for element on previous index and optionally it's next DOM sibling, making
    complexity of scheduled asynchronous rendering for most cases O(1). Which is of course great, but the indexing logic was
    the same as that for sorting - flat structure of object containing indexes with something like `"0.1.0"` for fragments,
    array and their children, and the biggest mistake - not include Components in structure, blocking real component teardown
    implementation. Another bad solution were to keep all elements and all fragments in separate objects
  - In `v0.3.0` changes, it should be changed to nested structure, with separate layer for every fragment, array and component.
      - use just arrays and number indexes instead of string indexed dictionary
      - RvdCreatedChildrenGroup is container for created component, array or fragment - it's children will be handled
        separately on its own level and when it achieve the start of the group when looking for previous sibling, it should
        call getter for the previousSibling of the group
      - So generally, nested structure with recurrenc
