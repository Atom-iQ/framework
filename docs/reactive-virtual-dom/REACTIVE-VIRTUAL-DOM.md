# Reactive Virtual DOM
### The architecture of Atom-iQ

#### Motivation
> The idea for this project came to my mind when I was looking for **RxJS** solutions for **React**, other
> than `redux-observable`. **RxJS** and reactive programming is something I missed in **React**, compared
> to the **Angular** in which I wrote earlier. Then I realized that such a combination does not make much
> sense - _the **Virtual DOM** architecture contradicts it_. The solutions I've seen are passing new values
> to props when new stream values come out. This obviously results in reconciliation and differentiation
> of the `vDOM` **Component** structure.
> That's not the point - it looks like these solutions track property changes that areâ€¦ **Observable**
> and know best when their values change.
>
> Although, the `vDOM` differentiation, which results in _**atomic**_ `DOM` updates, is definitely faster
> than doing such operations on the `DOM` tree, it's still doing operations (even if it's just checking)
> on the whole sub-tree, _**while it could be done on single (`vDOM`) nodes**_.
>
> Proof, that the `vDOM` reconciliation is important for performance, is the big difference between
> the differently optimized libraries.
>
> On the other hand, **React** is a great library to work, well-designed, especially with **Functional
> Components and hooks**. However, **hooks** were introduced to **React Functional Components**,
> to allow them to act like their internal context (closure) were kept.
>
> **Reactive Virtual DOM** acts completely different and *address these and more issues*.

### One change, that made a big difference
**Reactive Virtual DOM** has one base assumption:
- nodes and properties are distinguished to **Static** and **Observable**
  - **Static** are all synchronous **JS (JSX)** values, in other words, all
    standard `vDOM` values
  - **Observables**, could have the same values as **Statics**, but are
    "wrapped" inside an **Observable** stream

Which leads to the other assumptions:
- `rvDOM` nodes or properties, with connected (interpolated/bound)
  **Observables**, are the **Observers**
- connected **Observables** are coming more likely from state / props
- **"connected"** means that **Observable** state / prop is passed
  somewhere in **Components** returned `rvDOM`, but they aren't passed
  as values, but as references
- to know that state (or props, but **Observable** props are most likely
  just references to the state from parent components tree) was
  updated, no diffing is needed - *connected nodes / properties get
  notification directly from the source*, not touching other elements
- when connected node gets a notification about update with new
  value, it will either update a `DOM` property or child / children
- as everything that's changing in runtime is passed as a reference,
  **Component** functions are called just once they are added to `rvDOM`,
  then they're existing with internal closure context (**Component
  Rendering Context**)
- as a **Components** and **Fragments** are not `DOM` elements, their
  **Rendering Contexts** are existing inside their first `RvdDOMElement`
  parent's rendering context
- **Element Rendering Contexts** are really important, because while
  the element is existing in `rvDOM` and `DOM`, it's **Rendering Context** is
  keeping all the information about children shape and keeping them
  in sync
- **The exception**, when the `rvDOM` renderer is checking children elements, is when
  rendering dynamic lists

In **Atom-iQ**, after calling `start(rootRvDOM)(rootDOM)`, **Reactive
Virtual DOM Renderer** is creating `rvDOM` sub-trees, passing static and connecting (subscribing) **Observable**
state / props, rendering `DOM` sub-trees and creating corresponding trees of **Subscriptions**. All the **Subscriptions**
in `rvDOM` nodes are managed by the renderer - thanks to the **Subscription** nesting ability.

### Reactive Virtual DOM is always only one
Unlike the **Virtual DOM**, `rvDOM` is always one for the main `DOM` structure - after starting, the reference
to the top `RvdNode` will remain the same in the runtime. All nested nodes will have the same references too:
- **Statics** will have also the same `DOM` **Elements** and their references
- in case of streamable (changeable) nodes, **Observables** - there will be the same references to the streams,
  and their **Observers** will be in the parent, referenced tree
  - for the changeable sub-trees, situation is the same - when they are existing in the `DOM`, they are
    existing in the `rvDOM` too with the same references

It doesn't mean that `rvDOM` is _mutable_, it's **immutable**, but additionally it's **readonly** in case
of **JavaScript Objects**, but "inside" these **readonly** objects, new **immutable** `rvDOM` values are
streamed.

> #### Pre-evaluation
> This opens up big new possibilities for pre-evaluating code during compilation. Theoretically, it could
> be possible to create the initial `rvDOM` and `DOM` in the *pre-evaluation* stage - without any input data - just
> create state entities and connect (subscribe) to nodes. Then in the browser, after starting the application,
> just attach the pre-created nodes to the root `DOM`. The plan is to adapt [**Facebook's Prepack**](https://prepack.io/)
> and develop the solution to achieve it.

> #### SSR
> Similar to **Pre-evaluation** - I think that, in case of **Server Side Rendering**, it should be possible, to `hydrate`
> only **Observable** nodes or **Static** nodes with **Observable** props - the rest of **Statics** will be out
> of control of framework, as standard `DOM` nodes, but without corresponding `rvDOM` nodes - as the only thing,
> that framework is doing in case of statics is initial render.

### Reactive Virtual DOM, DOM, RxJS and it's push model
**ReactiveX (RxJS)** and its *push system*, is the ideal way to model the browser `DOM` events system. `DOM` **Events**
are also pushed, same way like **Observable** stream values. Unlike **Virtual DOM**, where it's change could
be completely different, than resulting `DOM` change, **Reactive Virtual DOM** is almost a 1:1 `DOM` model,
except that `DOM` don't see **Components** and **Fragments**. **Atomic** change in `rvDOM` is resulting in corresponding
change in `DOM`. Thanks to **RxJS**, `rvDOM` is also existing in runtime, almost the same way as `DOM` and have
the ability, to listen for multiple **Events** (from one source), without changing its references, completely
asynchronous - like in real `DOM`.

That makes programming in **Atom-iQ** and **Reactive Virtual DOM**  much more predictable - *developer has
the full control*, where and when the change happens and can be sure exactly which `DOM` elements will be updated

### "Concurrent mode" by default
Lastly, the **React** team is working on new set of features called "Concurrent mode". It means that rendering
(updating) tasks could be cancelled, when more urgent update happened or **React** can work on different state updates
concurrently. It can always render elements in memory, while waiting for asynchronous data.

**Atom-iQ** provides "Concurrent mode" features by default, thanks to the **Reactive Virtual DOM** architecture
- As dynamic content in **Atom-iQ** must be **Observable**, it could be cancelled (unsubscribing or operators)
  - When new update is happening before previous update finished, previous update could be cancelled just by
    `switchMap` operator
- **Atom-iQ** state updates are **atomic**, rendering could be synchronous or asynchronous
  - while rendering **Element's** children, it's not rendering them one by one (except they are all synchronous) - when
    **Element** is asynchrounous, it could even render 5 mins later than the siblings - **Atom-iQ** will render that **Element**,
    in correct order after finishing asynchronous operation - without touching other elements (except DOM parent and nextSibling,
    where it's added of course, for `appendChild` or `insertBefore`).
  - updates don't touching other **Elements**, so they are independent from other updates
- When **Atom-iQ** is creating and rendering Observable Elements, it's creating Observers and doesn't care if its source is streaming
  a value - it could create all **Reactive Virtual DOM**, without initial values and then update elements, when the value is emitted


## Examples, with described differences vs Virtual DOM

#### Consider that simple example
```typescript jsx
const App = () => {
  // const [name, setName] = useState('App') // in React
  const name = useState('App') // in Atom-iQ

  const handleChangeName = () => (name.v = 'Changed Name') // setName in React

  return (
    <main className="app">
      <button type="button" onClick={handleChangeName}>Change Name</button>
      <Layout name={name} />
    </main>
  );
};

const Layout = ({ name }) => (
  <section className="app-layout">
    <Header>{name}</Header>
    <Footer name={name} />
  </section>
);

const Header = ({ children }) => (
  <h1 className="app-header">{children}</h1>
);

const Footer = ({ name }) => (
  <footer className="app-footer" title={name}>
    <h2 className="app-footer__h2">{name}</h2>
    <h3 className="app-footer__h3">Footer</h3>
  </footer>
);
```
Ok, so what's happened, after clicking `Change Name`?

#### Virtual DOM
1. `setName` is called - `App` **Component** is re-rendered (function is called) with new `name` state
    value - `'Changed Name'`
2. in `App` **Component** `useState` is called for getting actual `name` value and `changeName` function is re-created
3. returned `vDOM` is compared against previous version - in this case `main` and `button` are skipped,
   but `Layout` `name` prop is changed
4. `Layout` **Component** is re-rendered with new `name` prop value
5. `vDOM` returned from `Layout` is compared against previous version - `Header` and `Footer` have props changed
6. `Header` is re-rendered with new `children` prop value
7. returned `vDOM` is compared against previous version and as value of Text node inside `h1` changed,
   that `Text` node is updated
8. `Footer` is re-rendered with new `name` prop value
9. returned `vDOM` is compared against previous version and as value of title attribute on `footer` changed,
   that attribute value is updated and as `Text` node inside `h2` changed, that text is also updated

#### Reactive Virtual DOM
1. `name` state value is changed - `next` method of the **State Subject** is called with `'Changed Name'`
   as a new value - it's emitting new `name` to connected subscribers
2. as `name` is connected (subscribed implicitly) in 3 places, that 3 tasks will run at once:
    - in `Header` subscription to the child `Text` node of `h1` is getting new value and Text node is updated
    - in `Footer` subscription to the `title` prop of `footer` is getting new value and attribute value is updated
    - in `Footer` subscription to the child `Text` node of `h2` is getting new value and Text node is updated

#### Classic non-real world example - update of state passed deeply down in structure
```typescript jsx
const App = () => {
  // const [name, setName] = useState('App') // in React
  const name = useState('App') // in Atom-iQ

  const handleChangeName = () => (name.v = 'Changed Name') // setName in React

  return (
    <main className="app">
      <Nest {name} />
      <button type="button" onClick={handleChangeName}>Change Name</button>
    </main>
  );
};

const Nest = ({ name }) => (
  <section className="a">
    <section className="b">
      <section className="c">
        <section className="d">
          <section className="e">
            <Nest2>
               <Nest3 name={name} />
            </Nest2>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
);

const Nest2 = ({ children }) => (
  <section className="f">
    <section className="g">
      <section className="h">
        <section className="i">
          <section className="j">
            {children}
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
);

const Nest3 = ({ name }) => (
  <section className="k">
    <section className="l">
      <section className="m">
        <section className="nested :)">
          <section className={name}>
            {name}
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
);
```

I know that it's really strange example, but it demonstrates the real power of **Reactive Virtual DOM** - the
scalability - operations during the update, are independent of app structure and size.

While in `vDOM`, for changing the most nested `section` `className` and `TextNode`, it needs a checking of all nested
structure, starting on re-calling the `App`, then all 3 `Nest` **Components** with their nested elements.

In **Reactive Virtual DOM**, it's almost the same as in previous example - now there are only 2 operations in the 2nd step,
so _**it's even faster**_.
